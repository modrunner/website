# What is Modrunner?

Modrunner is a bot that allows users on Discord to locate information on
and track updates of, modding projects on a variety of online platforms
such as CurseForge and Modrinth. This allows users to easily find and
share information about modding projects with others, and to know when
their favorite projects recieve updates to their files. To get started
with using Modrunner, please visit the Guides section.

# Governance

## Organizational Structure

Modrunner is developed and governed by the CyberMechanics. The
CyberMechanics Studio manages a number of projects, and not every member
of the team works on every project equally or sometimes at all.
Addtionally, many members of the open source community have worked on
Modrunner as well, and their contributions to the project are just as
important as the studio's. Ultimately, however, the studio manages and
directs the development of Modrunner using community contribution and
feedback. You can come talk to CyberMechanics staff in our Discord with
any questions.

## Licensing

Modrunner, its assets and its associated projects are licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license.
