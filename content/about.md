# What is Modrunner?

Modrunner is a bot that allows users on Discord to locate information on
and track updates of, modding projects on a variety of online platforms
such as CurseForge and Modrinth. This allows users to easily find and
share information about modding projects with others, and to know when
their favorite projects recieve updates to their files. To get started
with using Modrunner, please visit the [Docs](/docs) section.

## Design Principles

- **Easy to use:** Modrunner is designed to provide as painless a user experience as possible. To that end, Modrunner uses Discord's new slash command system, to make it easy to know command arguments and which ones are available to you. This improves usability, accessiblity and the general user experience with Modrunner.
- **Free and open source:** FOSS software is the backbone of companies and communities everywhere. We're committed to maintaining that Modrunner remain free for everyone to use, and that the source remain accessible, so that anyone can contribute to the future of Modrunner.

## Comparison with other similar services

Modrunner is of course, not the only bot that offers this kind of functionality. We've taken a look at some of the other available choices and have provided some insights about each, in an effort to help make your choice easier.

If you know of any other bots that should be on this list, come let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt)!

### Claptrack

[Claptrack by HypherionSA](https://claptrack.com) is likely the closest comparison in terms of functionality. Like Modrunner, it features CurseForge and Modrinth support, but also includes support for ATLauncher projects, Minecraft releases, Forge releases, Fabric releases, Quilt releases, GitHub releases, and Feed the Beast projects. Overall, Claptrack is much more focused on supporting a purely Minecraft-focused community than Modrunner and is a fine alternative.

Claptrack also features a web dashboard to help server administrators manage their tracked projects, as well as Minecraft crash report parsing.

### CurseForge-Bot

[CurseForge-Bot by ErdbeerbaerLP](https://github.com/ErdbeerbaerLP/Curseforge-Bot) is another bot that offers similar tracking functionality, though only for CurseForge Minecraft projects. Additionally, the bot requires self-hosting, which may be overly complicated and expensive for beginners.

## The Team

Modrunner is currently developed independently by Shane McMonigal ([beansquared](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt) on Discord, [smcmo](https://github.com/smcmo) on GitHub). Several members of the open source community have also contributed to Modrunner, you can view their contributions [on GitHub](https://github.com/modrunner). You can come [talk in our Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt) or [email us](mailto:contact@modrunner.net) with any questions.
