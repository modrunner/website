# List

Get a list of all the projects that are currently in tracking for your server, along with their names, project IDs and the channel their updates are being posted to.

## Usage

`/list <channel>`

- `channel` (optional) - filter by projects tracked in the specified channel

:::tip

You can tell if a project is being tracked on CurseForge or Modrinth by looking at its ID. Modrinth project IDs are composed of both letters and numbers, while CurseForge IDs are only numbers.
