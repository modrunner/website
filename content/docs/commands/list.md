# List

Get a list of all the projects that are currently in tracking for your server, along with their names, project IDs and the channel their updates are being posted to.

## Usage

::admonition{type="tip"}

You can tell if a project is being tracked on CurseForge or Modrinth by looking at its ID. Modrinth project IDs are composed of both letters and numbers, while CurseForge IDs are only numbers.

You will be limited to tracking a maximum of 100 projects per server. If you need more than this, come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt).
