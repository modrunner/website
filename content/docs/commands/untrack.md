# Untrack

Remove a project from tracking. Also useful if you want to change what channel the project's updates are posted to.

## Usage

`/untrack <project_id> <channel>`

- `project_id` (optional) - The ID of the project you want to stop tracking
- `channel` (optional) - The channel you want to stop tracking project(s) in

:::tip

- Specifying **both a project ID and channel** will untrack that project in the specified channel.
- Specifying a **project ID without a channel** will untrack that project in every channel it's tracked in.
- Specifying a **channel without a project ID** will untrack all projects in that channel.
- Providing neither parameter will untrack all projects in the server. As this is a potentially destructive action, the bot will ask for confirmation before doing this.

:::tip

You can get a project's ID from its project page on the Modrinth or CurseForge website, or by using the [Search](../commands/search) command.
