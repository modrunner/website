# Introduction

Modrunner is a Discord bot for finding information and monitoring for updates of Minecraft projects hosted on popular hosting sites like CurseForge and Modrinth. You can search for projects, and add projects to tracking to receive updates in Discord when these projects get updates.

If you can't find what you're looking for or you have a question, come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt).

## Quick Start

Get started with Modrunner in just a few minutes.

Ensure you have a [Discord account](https://discord.com/login) and your own server that you have bot permissions in.

Then invite the bot to join your server by using [this link](https://invite.modrunner.net) and following the prompts.

## Features

- **In-Discord searching**

  - Search supported platforms for modding projects and get information posted directly into Discord, without having to navigate between the website and Discord, and without having - to copy-paste links all the time.

- **Project update tracking**

  - For many people, Discord serves as a hub of activity for many of the communities they love. Why not incorporate notifications for project updates into them?
  - Get notified that your favorite projects have been updated, with all the flexiblity and customizability that the Discord client offers.

- **Customizable settings**

  - Make Modrunner your own - customize settings like notification style and changelog length (so your notifications don't look like CVS receipts!)
