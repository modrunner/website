# Introduction

Modrunner is a Discord bot for finding information and monitoring for updates of Minecraft projects hosted on popular hosting sites like CurseForge and Modrinth. You can search for projects, and add projects to tracking to receive updates in Discord when these projects get updates.

If you can't find what you're looking for or you have a question, come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.modrunner.net).

## Quick Start

Get started with Modrunner in just a few minutes.

Ensure you have a [Discord account](https://discord.com/login) and your own server that you have bot permissions in.

Then invite the bot to join your server by using [this link](https://invite.modrunner.net) and following the prompts.

## Features

- **In-Discord searching**

  - Search supported platforms for modding projects and get information posted directly into Discord, without having to navigate between the website and Discord, and without having - to copy-paste links all the time.

- **Project update tracking**

  - For many people, Discord serves as a hub of activity for many of the communities they love. Why not incorporate notifications for project updates into them?
  - Get notified that your favorite projects have been updated, with all the flexiblity and customizability that the Discord client offers.

- **Customizable settings**

  - Make Modrunner your own - customize settings like notification style and changelog length (so your notifications don't look like CVS receipts!)

## Design Principles

- **Easy to use:** Modrunner is designed to provide as painless a user experience as possible. To that end, Modrunner uses Discord's new slash command system, to make it easy to know command arguments and which ones are available to you. This improves usability, accessiblity and the general user experience with Modrunner.
- **Free and open source:** FOSS software is the backbone of companies and communities everywhere. We're committed to maintaining that Modrunner remain free for everyone to use, and that the source remain accessible, so that anyone can contribute to the future of Modrunner.

## Comparison with other similar services

Modrunner is of course, not the only bot that offers this kind of functionality. We've taken a look at some of the other available choices and have provided some insights about each, in an effort to help make your choice easier.

If you know of any other bots that should be on this list, come let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.modrunner.net)!

### Claptrack

[Claptrack by HypherionSA](https://claptrack.com) is likely the closest comparison in terms of functionality. Like Modrunner, it features CurseForge and Modrinth support, but also includes support for ATLauncher projects, Minecraft releases, Forge releases, Fabric releases, Quilt releases, GitHub releases, and Feed the Beast projects. Overall, Claptrack is much more focused on supporting a purely Minecraft-focused community than Modrunner and is a fine alternative.

Claptrack also features a web dashboard to help server administrators manage their tracked projects, as well as Minecraft crash report parsing.

### CurseForge-Bot

[CurseForge-Bot by ErdbeerbaerLP](https://github.com/ErdbeerbaerLP/Curseforge-Bot) is another bot that offers similar tracking functionality, though only for CurseForge Minecraft projects. Additionally, the bot requires self-hosting, which may be overly complicated and expensive for beginners.
