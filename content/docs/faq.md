# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I report issues with Modrunner?

The best way is to make an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/modrunner/discord-bot/issues). Otherwise, you can also [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt) and create a new support post in the Modrunner forum channel.

## I can only see some (or none) of Modrunner's commands.

Check to make sure you have permissions to use that command in the current channel. By default, commands like `/track` require the "Manage Channels" permission to use.

## Modrunner doesn't quite have what I'm looking for. Can you add it?

I'm always open to feedback and looking for ways to improve and add new functionality to Modrunner. Please let me know these things [in our Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt). Chances are, I'm already working on it as well. Check the [development board](https://github.com/users/smcmo/projects/11) to see what I'm currently developing.
